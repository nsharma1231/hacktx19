# Secure Your Flight

Crowdsourcing Security and Check-in Line Times for Airplane flights

## Getting Started

Run app.py on your local machine

### Prerequisites

Sqlite, Python, Flask


## What Inspired Us

We often find ourselves in situations where we arrive too early or too late to the airport. Either we end up having to wait for long periods of time for our flight, or even worse, missing it altogether. We wanted to build an app that would allow us to estimate exactly when our flight leaves (based on crowdsourcing data from security check in lines) so we could arrive exactly on time for our flights.

## What We Learned

We used HTML/CSS for the frontend design, Python Flask for backend and integration, and SQLLite for the database. We learned about many new skills including web development, how to create a full stack framework, and access APIs

## Challenges Faced

We used a lot of new technologies so we faced the most trouble with debugging our errors.
